# Weekly exercises
Repo storing weekly exercises on Haskell and the Lambda calculus. These exercises test core knowledge required to code in Haskell.

# Content
## Week 1
### Haskell
Setting up the Haskell environment - dealing with installs.
Basic Mathematical operations performed recursively (basic but helps with getting used to the syntax). Basic Interactions with lists.
Operations include: squaring, factorial, to the power of, and finding the range.

## Week 2
### Haskell
Using recursion to perform list operations.
Operations include: finding if an variable is in a list, removing from a list, comparing lists and sorting lists.

## Week 3
### Haskell
Using the map, filter, zip and zipWith functions. Perform the operations from Week 2 but now use the newly learned in-built functions.
### Lambda Calculus

## Week 4
### Haskell
Using list comprehension to perform all of the operations in Week 2 but now solely using list comprehension. 
Using list comprehension together with the functions learned in Week 3 to perform more interesting operations.
### Lambda Calculus

## Week 5
