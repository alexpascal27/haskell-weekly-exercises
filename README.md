# Weekly exercises
Repo storing weekly exercises on Haskell and the Lambda calculus. These exercises test core knowledge required to code in Haskell.

# Content
## Week 1
### Haskell
Setting up the Haskell environment - dealing with installs.
Basic Mathematical operations performed recursively (basic but helps with getting used to the syntax). Basic Interactions with lists.
Operations include: squaring, factorial, to the power of, and finding the range.

## Week 2
### Haskell
Using recursion to perform list operations.
Operations include: finding if an variable is in a list, removing from a list, comparing lists and sorting lists.

## Week 3
### Haskell
Using the map, filter, zip and zipWith functions. Perform the operations from Week 2 but now use the newly learned in-built functions.
### Lambda Calculus
Learned the basics of lambda and now applying the knowledge. Since a lambda term can be a variable, abstaction or application, its appropriate to be able to identify which one it is. Additionally, exercises test whether I can identify free and bounded variables as well as redexes.


## Week 4
### Haskell
Using list comprehension to perform all of the operations in Week 2 but now solely using list comprehension. 
Using list comprehension together with the functions learned in Week 3 to perform more interesting operations.
### Lambda Calculus
Learning to reduce lambda expressions to normal form. Understanding that some lambda expressions cannot be reduced to a normal form.

## Week 5
### Haskell
Learning to perform operations on trees containing integers.
### Lambda Calculus
Exercises revolving around Church Booleans and Numerals.

## Week 6
### Haskell
Making more complex functions for trees containing integers. Abstracting tree type (tree can now hold any type). Learning to program the lambda term as a data type. Performing basic operations on the basic data type.
### Lambda Calculus
Proving Church Numeral operations using reducing and proof by induction.

## Week 7
### Haskell
### Lambda Calculus
